# Devops

## Development

Programming and creating a software solution to some problem. Development starts when the software system begins being planned and ends when the development delivers a finished software product.  After the code was written - what happens?  The next steps for a software company have traditionally been handled by an operations team.

## Operations

The team or the process of taking software products, deploying them to production environment, and maintaining those applications in their hosted environment. In an on-premise solution, this might mean buying servers, managing networking, installing software packages, launching the application, opening it up to the public, monitoring the production application. 

## Devops
Devops is development in the operational space. When companies utilize devops, a lot of operation tasks become automated through development in the operational space.  Devops has become extremely popular in the industry in the last 10 or so years.  However, automation comes at a cost - When following devops, we can deploy code to a production environment extremely quickly and with fewer eyes on the code base.  This means that defects could easily make it to a production environment. For devops to be successful we cannot only automate deploying code, we must automate testing code as well.  Additionally, we must develop good testing habits for devops to be successful. For this reason, devops isn't often just considered an 'operational' technique.  Following devops permeates the entire development process.  For this reason, devops is often described as a 'culture'.
